                            <h3>Autobiography</h3>
                            <p>My name is Danny, and I am 27 years old. In 2020, I graduated from the Industrial Engineering and Management Department at National Chiao Tung University. In 2022, I completed the Python Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Talent Development Program at the Tzu Chi Foundation. I was born into a family of four, and we lived a comfortable and happy life. My mother was a teacher, so our home was always filled with the fragrance of books. This fostered my love for reading. My father worked in the technology industry for almost thirty years, and this inspired me to pursue a career in technology.</p>
                            <p>I have loved mathematics since I was young. Solving difficult problems gives me a great sense of achievement. While attending the math and science program at my high school in Hsinchu, I participated in the ARML LOCAL (American Regions Mathematics League) Taiwan Selection Contest with my classmates. We earned the opportunity to represent Taiwan in the ARML in the United States. We underwent special training together, working collaboratively to sharpen our skills and prepare for the competition. Although we did not achieve a high ranking in the end, the experience taught me valuable lessons and helped me understand the importance of teamwork.</p>
                            <p>During my university years, I took a lot of courses, including statistics, data analysis, and Python. It was my first exposure to programming and data analysis, and it sparked my interest in these fields.</p>
                            <p>During my master's studies, I took courses such as Experimental Design and Advanced Data Analysis and Data Science. In the process of learning data analysis, I found myself very interested in the field. In one of our projects, we used R programming language to analyze hospital patient data and predict whether they would revisit in the future. In another project, we analyzed data from various businesses to predict their future revenue. I was able to achieve good results in these projects, which further fueled my desire to pursue a career in data analysis.</p>
                            <p>For my paper, I used the double simulation method to construct individual value and moving range control charts for the Burr distribution new process. During the thesis writing process, I used MATLAB to simulate data and construct research methods. I also participated in a research project funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology where we used MATLAB and R to construct control charts for non-normal processes. Therefore, I am proficient in using MATLAB and R programming languages to solve problems.</p>
                            <p>After graduation, my first job was as a production line supervisor at Powertech Technology. The job required a lot of cross-departmental communication, personnel management, and crisis management, so I am skilled at communication and cooperation. During this time, I completed a project to improve production quality by using incentive mechanisms and personnel training to raise the quality awareness of department personnel. This project reduced human-caused abnormalities, improved production quality, reduced scrap, and improved departmental performance.</p>
                            <p>During my undergraduate and graduate studies, I became interested in programming languages and data analysis. In recent years, the demand for professionals in data science and big data analysis has increased, and this prompted me to leave my position as a production line supervisor at PTI and pursue a career in these fields. After leaving PTI, I participated in the Python Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Talent Development Program offered by TCFST. During the program, I learned how to use Python to clean and analyze messy historical data, as well as how to interpret the results of data analysis. We also completed a data analysis project on game types and sales using the skills we learned. Overall, it was a rewarding experience.</p>
                            <p>Currently, even after completing the training program at the TCFST, I continue to improve my programming skills and participate in related seminars during my free time. Although I do not have practical experience in the related field at present, I believe that if given the opportunity in the future, I will be able to apply what I have learned and create value.</p>
