                            <h3>Autobiography</h3>
                            <p>My name is Danny. I graduated from the Industrial Engineering and Management Department at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and completed the “Python AI and Data Science Talent Development Program” organized by the Tze-Chiang Foundation. I am currently working as an Assistant Researcher at the National Center for High-Performance Computing, where I focus on data analysis and visualization, transforming complex data into insightful information to support research and decision-making.</p>

                            <p>I grew up in a family of four with a warm and modest background. My mother is a schoolteacher, which cultivated my reading habits and love for learning from an early age. My father has worked in the tech industry for over 30 years, inspiring me to pursue a career in technology as well.</p>

                            <p>From a young age, I’ve had a strong interest in math and science. Solving complex problems has always given me a sense of accomplishment. In high school, I was in the math and science gifted program at Hsinchu Senior High School. I participated in the ARML LOCAL (American Regions Math League Taiwan Trials) and was selected to represent Taiwan in the ARML in the U.S. Although we did not achieve top results, the intensive training and teamwork taught me how to collaborate and solve problems together, reinforcing the importance of cooperation.</p>

                            <p>During my undergraduate studies, I took various courses in data analysis and programming, such as statistics and Python, which sparked my interest in programming and data science. In graduate school, I further pursued this interest by taking courses such as design of experiments, advanced data analysis, and data science. I also participated in several R-based projects, including predicting patient return rates and analyzing business revenue trends. These experiences greatly enhanced my skills in data analysis, model building, and result interpretation, solidifying my goal to enter the field of data analysis.</p>

                            <p>My master's thesis was titled "Using Compound Simulation to Construct I-MR Control Charts for the New Burr Distribution Process." I used Matlab to simulate data and build models, and I participated in a Ministry of Science and Technology project analyzing control charts for non-normal processes. These experiences equipped me to solve practical problems using Matlab and R.</p>

                            <p>After graduation, I worked as a Production Line Supervisor at Powertech Technology Inc., where I handled cross-department communication, personnel management, and on-site troubleshooting. I led a project to improve production quality by implementing incentive systems and training programs that strengthened quality awareness, successfully reducing human errors and scrap rates. This experience sharpened my skills in communication under pressure, project execution, resource integration, and problem-solving.</p>

                            <p>With the rapid growth of AI and data science in recent years and increasing market demand, I decided to pivot my career and joined the Tze-Chiang Foundation's Python training program. There, I learned to use Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, and completed a data analysis project focused on game genres and sales data, where I was fully involved in everything from data processing to report writing.</p>

                            <p>I now work at the National Center for High-Performance Computing, where I handle data processing, exploratory data analysis, and visual presentation. I continue to refine my programming and analytical skills. To enhance the quality of my visualizations, I’ve also learned HTML and JavaScript, and gained experience using Highcharts, Leaflet, and amCharts to build interactive dashboards and map-based visualizations, making data insights more intuitive and accessible.</p>

                            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy gardening and raising insects. Observing the growth of plants and insects brings me both relaxation and joy. On weekends, I like hiking and long walks to connect with nature, and I occasionally unwind by watching movies or enjoying a nice meal. These hobbies help me maintain a healthy work-life balance.</p>

                            <p>Although I am relatively new to the field of data science, I have a solid analytical foundation, a strong ability to learn, and a genuine passion for the work. I am confident that, given the opportunity, I can quickly adapt and contribute meaningful value to any team.</p>
